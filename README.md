# EA taskboss

This python code base was written using Pyside6 and Pyqt5. 

This is a simple todo app where users can add their to do list 
put some time limit as they wish to complete it on time. 

The main idea is to give the user a time limit, a deadline so the user can 
feel the pressure to complete the project / work on time.

Other main idea comes from the 2 minutes rule in which it says if you start
doing something, it is easier to keep it going. So starting with 2 minute timer, 
user can keep on doing whatever he is doing and can have easier time starting
the task in the first place
